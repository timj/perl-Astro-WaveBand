Astro::WaveBand
===============

This module provides transparent conversion of astronomical filter
names to wavelength and frequency and vice versa.  For example it
knows the wavelengths of the J, H and K near-infrared filters or the
filter names of the SCUBA submm camera.

This software is still in alpha release. It's been used in my
applications but there may be some future API tweaks required as more
telescopes/instruments are included.

Requirements
------------

No other modules are required.
Requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer.

Limitations
-----------

Currently the instrument specific knowledge only covers instruments
at the UKIRT and JCMT telescopes. Please send more instrument details.

Building
--------

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

This module was written by Tim Jenness <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> and
Brad Cavanagh of the Joint Astronomy Centre. Some static functions added
by Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> to support his work on the eSTAR
Project. Tim Lister added support for Las Cumbres telescopes.
