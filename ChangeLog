2007-03-09  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add WB, WD

2006-11-13  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add HARP support.

2005-10-06  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* WaveBand.pm: When converting from wavelength to filter in the
	_convert_to() function and using lookup table to do so, round the
	value obtained from the lookup table in the same fashion as the
	rounding of the given wavelength in order to avoid rounding issues
	when trying to compare floating-point numbers.

	* t/waveband.t: Test fix of above bug.

2004-12-08  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add comparison operators and overloaded comparison
	operators.

	* t/waveband.t: Test comparison operators.

2004-09-13  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* t/waveband.t: Use Test::More

	* WaveBand.pm: Add WFCAM

2003-07-16  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * WaveBand.pm: Added three static methods has_instrument(),
          has_filter() and is_observable() which pretty much do exactly
          what it says on the box. Check the inline POD for details.
          Added a %TELESCOPE lookup hash to go along with the existing
          %FILTERS lookup hash.

2003-05-30  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Update UIST filters.

2003-01-31  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add support for JCMT heterodyne instruments

2002-08-14  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add UIST support

2002-06-04  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: Add Blank for UFTI and add SCUBA filters. Still a
	problem with multiple wavelengths associated with a single filter.

2002-05-28  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* WaveBand.pm: New CPAN release 0.04 (with README!)

2002-05-16  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* CPAN release 0.03

2001-12-05  Tim Jenness  <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* WaveBand.pm (_convert_to): Make sure that we do no require full
	precision when matching wavelength against filter.

2001-11-27  Tim Jenness  <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* First version
