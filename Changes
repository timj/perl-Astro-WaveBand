Revision history for Astro::WaveBand

0.10 2023-04-17

  - Add Namakanui receivers for JCMT.

0.09 2014-02-13

  - Add 1.69CH4_l filter for UFTI.

  - Add RxA3M for JCMT.

0.08 2012-06-19

  - Include Sloan, PanSTARRS w & Y and solar filters.

  - Add 1.644FeII filter for WFCAM.

0.07 2010-12-30

  - Use Module::Build.

  - Add 2.122MK filter for UFTI.

  - Add UIST Y_MK filter.

  - Add 1.619nBH filter for WFCAM.

  - Add Y+MK filter for UFTI.

  - Add WB, WD.

  - Add HARP support.

  - When converting from wavelength to filter in the
    _convert_to() function and using lookup table to do so, round the
    value obtained from the lookup table in the same fashion as the
    rounding of the given wavelength in order to avoid rounding issues
    when trying to compare floating-point numbers.

  - t/waveband.t: Test fix of above bug.

  - Add comparison operators and overloaded comparison operators.

  - t/waveband.t: Test comparison operators.

  - t/waveband.t: Use Test::More.

  - Add WFCAM.

  - Added three static methods has_instrument(),
    has_filter() and is_observable() which pretty much do exactly
    what it says on the box. Check the inline POD for details.
    Added a %TELESCOPE lookup hash to go along with the existing
    %FILTERS lookup hash.

  - Update UIST filters.

0.06 2003-01-31

  - Add support for JCMT heterodyne instruments.

  - Add UIST support.

0.05 2002-06-04

  - Add Blank for UFTI and add SCUBA filters. Still a
    problem with multiple wavelengths associated with a single filter.

0.04 2002-05-28

  - Included README in release.

  - Add licence statement.

0.03 2002-05-16

  - CPAN release 0.03

0.02 2001-12-05

  - Make sure that we do not require full
    precision when matching wavelength against filter.

0.01 2001-11-27

  - First version.
